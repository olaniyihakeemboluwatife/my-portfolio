  about: `
  With a background in Surveying and Geoinformatics and a passion for software development, I transitioned into full-stack web development, where I have been building scalable, efficient, and robust applications. I lead a tech hub, BGR Institute, where I teach web development, data analysis, and other technology skills to aspiring developers.

I’m well-versed in JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, PHP, and MySQL, among other technologies, and I’m always eager to learn and implement new tools and technologies.

When I’m not coding or teaching, I’m learning about the latest tech trends and contributing to open-source projects.
